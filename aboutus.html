    <p class="lead"><center>We all have faced the problem where we would havemissed someinformation that was sent in the official groups,sometimes lost track of theinformation sent. Also the study materials that aresent can get lost in the chats. Sowe have thought of designing acoursemanagement systemwhere for eachcourse the professor can directly send the detailsand any other announcements tothe students. Also the student will be able to seeall the available courses and enrollin any new course they would want to feature in.
